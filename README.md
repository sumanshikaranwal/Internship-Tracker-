# Internship-Tracker-
This is a web based project which is used to track the work done by the interns in their summer internships. Interns update their work on daily basis. Then company check and approve based on percentage as to how much work is done. This can be referred by the faculty and helps them to keep a track of what their students are exactly doing.
